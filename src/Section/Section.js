                  <div className="content">The prestigious overall champions trophy was won by Hyderabad & Bengaluru in 2018 & 2019 respectively. Last year all players were asked to write down why they would want to win the trophy and attach the write up as pride rolls to the trophy to remind our athletes that
                  we are strength and face of Accolite Family which always stands together.

                  <div className="content">
                    The 1st edition of this event was named as Inter-location Sports. It was renamed as Accolite       
                    Olympics from the 2nd edition.  After a lot of efforts, a new and eye catching  logo for Accolite Olympics 2020 was finalized this year.     		
                    <br/>
                    In the first edition of the event in 2018, Delhi Smashers, Bengaluru Blokechains (was renamed as Bengaluru Bolts in 2019) and Hyderabad Strikers competed for the coveted trophy. In 2019, Mumbai City & Chennai Spartans entered the arena, along with other three teams, to make the event more exciting and challenging. With the addition of Bengaluru Thunder, the number of teams in 2020 has gone up to five making the event more scintillating and competitive.

                    It was a hard-fought battle for Cricket, Futsal, Carrom, Table Tennis, Badminton and Online Gaming (PUBG) in 2019. In the 2nd edition, Women Cricket was introduced and Delhi Smashers won it. In 2020, again three new games namely Throwball, Volleyball and Athletics - Track & Throw have been introduced. Considering the safety of the players as many of them got injured last year, Futsal has been dropped from the event.There is also an element of surprise in “Fun Games”.
